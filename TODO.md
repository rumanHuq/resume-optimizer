Q1, 2026 goals
- focus on shifting to AI engineering. I have exposure to tool-calling, vector indexing
- landing a job with 9 years of experience in web development
- snowboarding
- learning to dance, shuffle at home to start. Then move to taking a course
- record myself with tutorials, info about AI models and publish more
- hybrid workout, focusing to improve aesthetics and vo2 max

predicaments
- Job is the highest priority to secure, but I want to focus on snowboarding as well without feeling guilty of not looking for a job
- I naturally become pessimistic, and I would love to practice positiveness about life
- I am doing Push/Pull/Leg, how can modify or alter to train for vo2?
- I am not meeting friends actively, how can incorporate there inputs, and make them part of my life

What you can do
 - Give next 7 days plan to kick off, so that I don't get stuck on analysis paralysis


Draft out a 4 day PPL-hybrid workout split. I am doing PPL for the last 3 years, so I know the weighlifting part. Incorporating cardio is the challenge.
I want to be better my vo2 max level
